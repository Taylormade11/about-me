  <section class="aboutMe">
    Thanks for playing along. As you now know, I am 25 years old and have a 7 year old son. I really hate cats, but I am a huge dog lover! I lived in Seattle about 2 years ago, and am just moving back for school. I can't stand the texture of bananas, but I love the taste and well... they're healthy, so I drink one in my shakes every morning! I hope to get to know you all more as we grow together throughout our time here at CodeFellows. Thanks for stopping by!

      <li>First &amp foremost, I enjoy hanging out with my family. My son really enjoys going to the skatepark and we have been spending a lot of our free time riding around the park together!</li>
      <li>I really love building drones from scratch, FPV racing drones or 5' commercial UAS rigs, they both give me my fix!</li>
      <li>I have a huge passion for racing drones competitively. I have travelled all over the United States racing them professionally and hope to continue this hobby/sport far into the future</li>
      <li>I spend a lot of my free time soldering electronics &amp playing with Rasberry Pi's/Arduinos.</li>
      <li>It has taken some time to grow on me, but I really enjoy running when I can. I find it a very good way to get out my jitters and get my exercise in, while also being able to get some good thinking and problem solving done.</li>
      <li>I love playing games of nearly any kind. Board games, video games, even tag with my son and his friends.</li>
      <li>As of lately, I have enjoyed learning anything and everything I can about coding &amp programming.</li>
      <li>I have a serious pizza addiction! It may not be the healthiest food, but it sure does hit the spot!</li>
      <li>I have and older brother and a younger sister who I really enjoy spending time with when I can. Everytime we are able to get together we have a blast as if we were kids all over again.</li>
      <li>Even though I have slowed down since having my son, I love anything and everything that gets the adrenaline pumping! Skydiving, riding motorcycles, tumbling... anything to get the adrenalive levels up!</li>
