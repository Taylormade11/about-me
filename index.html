    Thanks for playing along. As you now know, I am 25 years old and have a 7 year old son. I really hate cats, but I am a huge dog lover! I lived in Seattle about 2 years ago, and am just moving back for school. I can't stand the texture of bananas, but I love the taste and well... they're healthy, so I drink one in my shakes every morning! I hope to get to know you all more as we grow together throughout our time here at CodeFellows. Thanks for stopping by!
